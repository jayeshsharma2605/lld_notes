# 14 — Snake and Ladder

**Playlist lesson:** 14 of 43  
**Author:** Jayesh Sharma  
**Focus:** Simple explanation, practical example and interview preparation.

## 1. Core idea

Represent board positions as integers, players as current positions and snakes/ladders as start-to-end mappings. A dice roll proposes the next position.

## 2. Design workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
 A[Understand requirement]-->B[Identify objects and responsibilities]
 B-->C[Define interfaces and relationships]
 C-->D[Walk through the main scenario]
 D-->E[Check edge cases and tests]
```

## 3. Example and design decisions

Inject a Dice interface for deterministic tests. Clarify overshoot rules, extra turns and whether a player must land exactly on the final square.

## 4. What to remember

- Start from requirements and use cases, not from a pattern name.
- Give each class a clear responsibility and protect its invariants.
- Prefer composition and focused interfaces when they reduce coupling.
- Identify error paths, object lifecycle and concurrent access where relevant.
- Add abstractions only when they isolate a real point of change.

## 5. Interview practice

Explain the design in two minutes. Draw the key classes and one sequence. Then answer: what can change, what can fail, and what must remain true when two requests arrive together?

## 6. C++ implementation hints

- Use enum class for finite states and clear domain types for identifiers and money.
- Use RAII and smart pointers according to ownership; do not use shared_ptr by default.
- Inject dependencies through constructors instead of relying on global state.
- Protect the complete logical operation when shared mutable state is involved.
- Test normal flow, invalid input, boundaries and failure handling.
